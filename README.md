# SQL-FOR-DATA-SCIENCE-IBM-PROJECT
Here I have worked on a real world dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal.<br/>
Much of the world's data resides in databases. SQL (or Structured Query Language) is a powerful language which is used for communicating with and extracting data from databases. A working knowledge of databases and SQL is a must if you want to become a data scientist.<br/>
These are hands on practical notebooks that will show you how to get data or information using SQL from a database and use Python to analyse that data in Jupyter notebook.
